"#This program simulates the following experiment. There are 100 closed lockers. Start with the first locker and for every locker open it. Now, starting with the second locker, for this locker and every second locker after that, if the locker is open, close it; if it is closed, open it. Then, starting with the third locker, for this locker and every third locker after that, if the locker is open, close it; if it is closed, open it. Continue with the nth locker changing the "position" of every nth locker until n = 100. So the Program Prints out the locker numbers that remain open. It is also noticed that number of lockers that remain open are squares of int numbers from one up to ten. It reminds me this English saying 'Apple doesn't fall far from the tree'"
